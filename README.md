# Data-analysis_working-samples

This repository contains some of my hand-on projects on data analysis. The goal is to familarize myself with the standard Python libraries in data science and machine learning, such as pandas, seaborn, numpy, and matplotlib. Meanwhile, it is a good exercise to get used to data preparation, data cleaning, and data engineering.
